This is the public comment tracker for Data Format Description Language (DFDL) working group's version 1.0 document for 2020. This obsoletes previous versions, GFD #174 and #207 (available at https://www.ogf.org/documents).

Public comment is open for approximately 60 days, until January 2 2020.

To make a comment, simply OPEN A NEW ISSUE using the menu (usually at the top right of your screen). Brief affirmative comments are welcome - not just suggestions for changes. Public comments are an excellent way to demonstrate community engagement for a document.
