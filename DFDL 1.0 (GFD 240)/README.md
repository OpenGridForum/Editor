This is the public comment tracker for Data Format Description Language (DFDL) working group's version 1.0 document for 2020. This obsoletes previous versions, GFD #174 and #207 (available at https://www.ogf.org/documents).

Public comment is open for approximately 60 days, until January 2 2020.

To make a comment, simply OPEN A NEW ISSUE. You can do this by selecting "Issues" (usually towards the top left of your screen), then the green "New Issue" tab on the right of the subsequent screen. 

Brief affirmative comments are welcome - not just suggestions for changes. Public comments are an excellent way to demonstrate community engagement for a document.
